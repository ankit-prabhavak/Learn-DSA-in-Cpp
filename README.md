# Learn-DSA-in-Cpp

Welcome to the **Learn-DSA-in-Cpp** repository.

This repository is created to help students understand **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**. It is useful for interview preparation, competitive programming, and building strong problem-solving skills.

---

## Contents of the Repository

The repository contains implementations of important DSA topics with clear and readable C++ code.

### Basic Data Structures

- **Arrays**  
  Operations like insertion, deletion, rotation, and common array problems.
- **Linked Lists**  
  Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with basic operations.
- **Stacks**  
  Implementation using arrays and linked lists, along with standard stack problems.
- **Queues**  
  Simple queue, circular queue, and dequeue implementations.

### Advanced Data Structures

- **Trees**  
  Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal techniques.
- **Graphs**  
  Graph representation using adjacency list and matrix, BFS, DFS, and cycle detection.

### Algorithms

- **Searching Algorithms**  
  Linear search and binary search (iterative and recursive).
- **Sorting Algorithms**  
  Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

## Purpose of This Repository

- Code is written in **simple and standard C++**
- Suitable for **beginners and intermediate learners**
- Organized topic-wise for easy understanding
- Focuses on logic and implementation rather than shortcuts
- Helpful for **college exams, interviews, and practice**

---

## Current Status

This repository is still under development. More topics such as **heaps, hash maps, dynamic programming, and advanced problems** will be added gradually.
